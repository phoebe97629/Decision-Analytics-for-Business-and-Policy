### Problem statement
It is important to not only consider a time minimization problem, but also a cost minimization problem, where a significant cost can occur to prepare the potential PODs to a fully functional care-giving centers, as well as the transportation cost to transport patients under emergent situation. The project focuses on balancing the two objectives, deciding on which potential POD site should be opened and what are the numbers of patients transporting from each hospital to each potential POD site.
This report considers two scenarios:
1. A fixed patient amount, which the number of patients going to each hospital is known.
2. Patient amount under uncertainty, which the number of patients going to each hospital is uncertain,
with some probabilities.
The model will suggest the best strategy to open the potential PODs and transporting patients from the hospital to the PODs.

### Model Implementation
Use POD_DISTANCe.ipynb and patients_distribution to get distance metrics and patient number, or directly use the csv files pre-generated data. Proj.py correspond to scenario 1(weighted approch) Proj_STO.py correspond to scenario 2 (Stochastic Approach)
